# Assignment 6

## Create a calculator using tkinter 

so , i'm complete the this task and learn to how to work tkinter and some more functions about the tkinter
so now  discuss the about tkinter

#  tkinter :
tkinter it helps us to create the GUI Applications

and there are four steps that you have to keep in mind:-

................................................
step 1 -> import tkinter,
step 2 -> gui interaction,
step 3 -> adding inputs,
step 4 -> main loop
................................................

for example : from tkinter import 
              window = Tk()
              inp = Label(window , text= 'Hello World')
              inp.pack()
              window.mainloop()

.pack()  are compulsory so that's mean you are define a Label's , Entry Box , Button's ,Frames and  also mainloop.......

Eg -> entry = Entry(window)
     entry.pack()
    
Eg -> b = Button(window , text = 'button_name')
      b.pack()

like that.....

and some more functions like backgraund color and foregraund color
backgraund color -> bg
foregraund color(text color) -> fg
like that.....

and more more more function are include in tkinter....

so, now discuss about Assignment
now divided to Assignment to some steps

### step 1: calculator design
like size of window , title name , buttons , entry box for show the output like that..

### step 2: write your code
simply write your code to step by step 
for example: import tkinter
             set size of window popup
             backgraund color
             then 
             create a entry box for the ouptup
             create buttons ( 0 - 9 )
             create operators ( + , - , * , / , = )
             like that
             create a functions to perform tasks like addition , subtraction , multiplication , division
