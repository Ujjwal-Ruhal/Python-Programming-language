and delete a element and like more )
and the basic syntax of dictionary is : 
dictionary_name = { key : value , key : value , ........}

like that

# task-2: Demonstrate List Slicing
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.

task-2:
so, i'm learn to this task 
like ( how to create a list , and how fill tha data  , and list functions - add element,delete element and more )

the mager difference between list vs dictionary

           list            dictionary
symbol      []                  {}
Eg:       [1,2,3,4]         {key:value,key:value}
like that

list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(list) # output: [1,2,3,4,5]
