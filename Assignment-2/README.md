# Assignment 2 : Control Structures in Python

## Task-1 : Check the number is odd or even

So I'm using ( if-else Condition ) to solve this problem.
<br>
## if Condition:

if (test expression):<br>
    statement
    <br>
else:<br>
    statement
<br>
if condition:<br>
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
else:<br>
    # Code to execute if the condition is false

## check the number is odd or even

### the code syntax is:

if (n%2==0): <br>
    print('even')<br>
else:<br>
    print('odd')


## Task-2: Sum of Integers From 1 to 50 <br>
using for loop
<br>
so, I'm using ( for loop ) to solve this problem.<br>
# for loop:<br>
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
for example: print ( Hello ) 100 times so you no use to copy paste like this
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
..................... like that
<br>
so, you use for loop is the best way to solve this type of problem's.
<br>
# Task 2: the syntax of code is
<br>
n=0 #create a variable
<br>
for i in range(1,51): #1,2,3,.......,50<br>
    n=n+i
print(n)
<br>
that's it
<br>
Thank you
