#Assignment 2 : Control Structures in Python

##Task-1 : Check the number is odd or even

So I'm using ( if-else Condition ) to solve this problem.
#if Condition:

if (test expression):
    statement
else:
    statement

if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is false

##check the number is odd or even

#the code syntax is:

if (n%2==0): 
    print('even')
else:
    print('odd')


##Task-2: Sum of Integers From 1 to 50
using for loop

so, I'm using ( for loop ) to solve this problem.
#for loop: A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
for example: print ( Hello ) 100 times so you no use to copy paste like this
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
print('Hello')
..................... like that

so, you use for loop is the best way to solve this type of problem's.

# Task 2: the syntax of code is

n=0 #create a variable
for i in range(1,51): #1,2,3,.......,50
    n=n+i
print(n)

that's it
Thank you
